    Set the PWM duty cycle for a specified channel on the DFRobot Expansion Board.

    The DFRobot Expansion Board provides four groups of PWM ports, which can be controlled
    via I2C communication from the Raspberry Pi to the on-board STM32 microcontroller.
    The VP port can supply 6-12V external power to the PWM port. When not powered, the
    voltage of PWM âŠ• is 3.3V.

        channel (int): The PWM channel to set (1-4).

        ValueError: If the specified channel or duty cycle is out of range.
